Alfred 2 Workflows
==================

A (hopefully growing) collection of Alfred 2 workflows. Some of these workflows are (or will be) rewrites or extensions of other people's work. I've tried to provide proper attribution where applicable.

metro transit bus info
----------------------

This is derived from the work David Ferguson did on his Weather workflow. The difference is that it provides MetroTransit bus arrival times instead of weather conditions.

The workflow responds to the keywords 'busroute', 'busdirection', 'busstop', and 'nexttrip'. It is important that you set your default bus route, direction, and stop using the keywords before requesting next arrival times.
